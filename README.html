<H2>krb525 Overview</H2>

<P>krb525 is a tool for converting arbitrary K5 tickets from one client
to another. It consists of a client program (krb525) and a daemon program
(krb525d) which must run as root on the KDC. The user runs the krb525 client
program giving it the following:</P>

<UL>
<LI>A target client and server for the desired ticket. By default the server
is krbtgt/&lt;realm&gt;</LI>

<LI>A target credentials cache name for the convrted ticket.</LI>

<LI>A keytab file or credentials cache. If a credentials cache is given
and a ticket exists in it for the given target server it will be used as
the ticket for modification. This allows a krbtgt to be acquired before
hand with kinit with certain characteristics (renewal time, forwarding,
etc.) that will be present in the converted ticket. Otherwise a ticket
for the target client and server is acquired.</LI>

<LI>The name of the destination credentials cache. </LI>
</UL>

<P>The krb525 program contacts the krb525d and authenticates using the
credentials from the keytab or cache. It then sends the krb525d a copy
of the ticket to be converted and the name of the target client principal.
The krb525d daemon checks the contacting client, target client and host
that originated the connection against it's configuration for legality.
Assuming these check out, it looks up the service's key, decrypts the ticket,
changes the client name to that of the target client, reencrypts the ticket
and sends it back to the client. The client krb525 program then does some
further massaging of the unencrypted credentials and put the converted
credentials and ticket into the specified cache.</P>

<H2>Building krb525 </H2>

<P><B>Run ./configure</B></P>

<P>krb525 uses an autoconf generated configure file. The first step is
to run ./configure. One or more of the following options will be needed:</P>

<DT>--with-krb5=PATH</DT>

<DD>Specify the path to the Kerberos 5 installation directory.</DD>

<DT>--with-krb5-obj=PATH</DT>

<DD>Specify path to the Kerberos 5 build directory. This is needed to build
the krb525d daemon.</DD>

<DT>--with-krb5-src=PATH</DT>

<DD>Specify path to the Kerberos 5 source directory. This is needed to
build the krb525d daemon.</DD>

<P><B>Run make</B></P>

<P>This should build the client, krb525, and daemon, krb525d, programs.</P>

<H2>Installing krb525</H2>

<P>You will need to create two principals for running krb525. The first
is the principal &quot;krb525d/&lt;host&gt;&quot; where &lt;host&gt; is
the hostname of the host that will be running the krb525d daemon which
must be one of your KDCs. The second principal is for the client and may
be any arbitrary name. For these examples let's assume it's &quot;krb525&quot;.
Note that it's possible to have any number of clients each with a different
principal.</P>

<P>You may also want to create a principal &quot;test&quot; for testing.</P>

<P><B>krb525d daemon</B></P>

<P>On the host where the daemon will run, add the krb525d/&lt;host&gt;
key to the keytab. Install the daemon binary in your krb5/sbin directory.</P>

<P>Add the following line to /etc/services (note that this port number
was grabbed out of thin air and is in no way offical):</P>

<PRE>krb525            6565/tcp</PRE>

<P>Then add the following line to /etc/inetd.conf and restart your inetd
daemon:</P>

<PRE>krb525        stream    tcp    nowait    root    /krb5/sbin/krb525d</PRE>

<P><B>The krb525.conf configuration file</B></P>

<P>In your krb5 directory, create the directory etc if it doesn't already
exist and create a krb525.conf file. This file should look like the following:</P>

<PRE>allowed_clients = 
      krb525@NCSA.EDU
      ;</PRE>

<PRE>client_mappings = {
      test0 test1 = test2 test3 ;
      test4 = test 5;
}</PRE>

<PRE>allowed_hosts = 
      10.0.0.1
      somehost.somewhere.com
      ;</PRE>

<P>The allowed_clients list specifies the list of client principals that
are allowed to use the krb525 service. If a principal is specified without
a realm then the default realm is assumed.</P>

<P>The client_mappings list specifies which principal conversions may be
transformed in regard to the ticket's client. In this example either test0
or test1 may be converted to test2 or test3 and test4 maybe converted to
test5.</P>

<P>The allowed_hosts list specifies which hosts may connect to krb525d.
Hosts may be given as their IP&nbsp;address or fulle hostname.</P>

<P>You also specify a seperate configuration for specific clients by adding
a list like the following:</P>

<PRE>test0 = {</PRE>

<PRE>      target_clients = test1 test 2 ;
      allowed_hosts = someother.host.edu ;</PRE>

<PRE>}</PRE>

<P>Rules for the configuration file:</P>

<UL>
<LI>All strings and characters must be delimited by whitespace or a carriage
return.</LI>

<LI>The wildcard characters * and ? are acceptable.</LI>
</UL>

<P><B>krb525 Client</B></P>

<P>To install the client add the key for the krb525 principal to the keytab
on the client's host and install the krb525 program in the krb5/bin directory.</P>

<H2>Running krb525</H2>

<P>On the client host as root, run the following:</P>

<PRE>krb525 -k -m krb525 -v test /tmp/ccache.test</PRE>

<P>This will use krb525's key in the keytab to get a krbtgt for the client
principal &quot;test&quot; and put it into the credentials cache &quot;/tmp/ccache.test&quot;.
If you run into problems check the syslog on the daemon's host. The daemon
will log as facility daemon.</P>

<P>If you want to specify options in the krbtgt currently what you do is
use the keytab and kinit to create a krbtgt with the options you want and
then use krb525 to change the client. For example to get a forwardable
krbtgt with a renewable life of 7 days:</P>

<P>kinit -k -f -r 7d -c /tmp/ccache.krb525 krb525</P>

<P>krb525 -c /tmp/ccache.krb525 -v test /tmp/ccache.test</P>
